## Project Overview

Gaming Forum is a community-driven discussion platform targeted at gamers. Users can register, create posts (threads), comment on posts, and reply to comments (nested replies). Moderation and basic admin tools allow community maintainers to manage content.

Use case examples:
- Game strategy discussions
- Tournament announcements and signups
- Community Q&A and support threads
- User-created guides and walkthroughs

---

## Key Features

- User registration, login, and profile pages
- Create, edit, delete discussion posts (threads)
- Rich commenting with nested replies (reply-to-reply)
- Post categories / tags for content organization
- Post search and basic filtering (by category, tags, author)
- Moderation features: edit/delete posts and comments (admin/moderator roles)
- Notifications for replies and mentions (if implemented)
- Asset bundling with Vite for fast frontend builds
- PHPUnit integration for automated tests

If any of these are not yet implemented in the codebase, treat them as the intended functional scope and implement as needed.

---

## Tech Stack

- Backend: PHP (Laravel framework)
- Frontend tooling: Vite, npm
- DB: SQLite (dev), MySQL / PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
- Testing: PHPUnit / Laravel Testbench
- Optional: Redis for cache & queues, Supervisor or queue workers for background jobs

---

## Architecture Overview

- MVC structure (Laravel): Models, Controllers, Views
- Threads (posts) model — central resource
- Comments model — polymorphic or belongsTo Thread; supports parent_id for nested replies
- Tags / Categories — relational tables for filtering
- Notifications / Events — Laravel events, broadcast (optional)

Recommended DB indices:
- threads: (user_id), (category_id), (created_at)
- comments: (thread_id, parent_id), (user_id)
- tags pivot: (thread_id, tag_id)

---

## Quick Start — Local Development

1. Clone
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjanarathnyke/Gaming-forum.git
   cd Gaming-forum
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Install JS dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Copy env and generate app key
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. (Optional) Configure DB
   - For SQLite (quick dev):
     ```bash
     touch database/database.sqlite
     # In .env:
     # DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
     # DB_DATABASE=/full/path/to/database/database.sqlite
     ```
   - For MySQL/Postgres: set DB_* variables in `.env`.

6. Run migrations and seeders
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

7. Symlink storage and set permissions
   ```bash
   php artisan storage:link
   chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
   ```

8. Start dev servers
   - Vite (hot reload):
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Laravel server:
     ```bash
     php artisan serve
     # Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
     ```

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure these important variables:

Required / common:
- APP_NAME=Gaming Forum
- APP_ENV=local / production
- APP_KEY= (generated by php artisan key:generate)
- APP_DEBUG=true / false
- APP_URL=http://localhost

Database:
- DB_CONNECTION=sqlite|mysql|pgsql
- DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
- DB_PORT=3306
- DB_DATABASE=your_db
- DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
- DB_PASSWORD=your_db_pass

Mail (for production notifications/password resets):
- MAIL_MAILER=smtp
- MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
- MAIL_PORT=587
- MAIL_USERNAME=...
- MAIL_PASSWORD=...
- MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=hello@yourdomain.com
- MAIL_FROM_NAME="Gaming Forum"

Queues & Cache:
- QUEUE_CONNECTION=database|redis
- CACHE_DRIVER=file|redis|memcached
- REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1

Vite:
- VITE_APP_NAME="${APP_NAME}"

See `.env.example` for the full set.

---

## Database & Seeding

- Create migrations for threads, comments, tags, users (if not present).
- Seeder example:
  ```bash
  php artisan make:seeder DemoDataSeeder
  php artisan db:seed --class=DemoDataSeeder
  ```
- For test data, Faker and factories are recommended.

---

## Running Tests

Run PHPUnit/Laravel test suite:
```bash
php artisan test
# or
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
Use an in-memory SQLite DB for fast tests:
- Configure `phpunit.xml` or `.env.testing` with:
  ```
  DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
  DB_DATABASE=:memory:
  ```

---

## Build & Production Steps

1. Install production dependencies
   ```bash
   composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```

2. Environment
   - Set APP_ENV=production
   - Set APP_DEBUG=false
   - Ensure APP_KEY is set

3. Cache & optimize
   ```bash
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan route:cache
   php artisan view:cache
   ```

4. Run migrations
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --force
   ```

5. Background workers (if using queues)
   - Use Supervisor or systemd to run `php artisan queue:work --sleep=3 --tries=3`

## Deployment Options & Checklist

Recommended hosts for Laravel apps:

- Laravel Forge / Vapor (first-class support)
- DigitalOcean App Platform or droplet with Docker
- Render / Railway (simple container / web service)
- Heroku (requires buildpack or Docker)
- Docker Compose on a VPS

Checklist before going public:
- [ ] APP_ENV=production, APP_DEBUG=false
- [ ] Secure APP_KEY and secrets (do not commit .env)
- [ ] Set up robust database backups
- [ ] Configure HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Configure queue workers / scheduler (cron)
- [ ] Configure CORS and rate limiting for APIs
- [ ] Audit package dependencies and update to latest patches

Example: Deploy with Docker Compose (basic)
- Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml (web + db + redis)
- Build & run:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --build
  docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --force
  docker compose exec app php artisan config:cache
  ```

Render / DigitalOcean quick steps:
- Push code to GitHub
- Connect repository to Render/DigitalOcean App Platform
- Configure build commands:
  - Build: `composer install --no-dev && npm ci && npm run build`
  - Start: `php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port $PORT` (or use a proper webserver like Nginx + PHP-FPM)
- Set environment variables in the platform UI

---

## Domain, SSL & DNS

- Point your domain A record to the server IP (or configure CNAME for platforms).
- Use Let's Encrypt to provision SSL (Forge, Certbot, or platform integrations).
- Configure secure headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options) via web server or middleware.

---

## Security & Hardening Checklist

- Keep dependencies up to date (composer & npm).
- Use HTTPS (TLS) and redirect HTTP -> HTTPS.
- Disable debug in production (APP_DEBUG=false).
- Use strong DB passwords and limit DB user permissions.
- Rate-limit endpoints (Laravel throttle middleware).
- Validate and sanitize all user input (requests & policies).
- Use Laravel authorization (Policies/Gates) for actions like delete/edit.
- Regularly backup DB and uploaded assets.
- Protect file uploads and serve media securely (e.g., signed temporary URLs).

---

## Scaling & Performance

- Use Redis for cache, sessions, and queues for high traffic.
- Offload static assets to a CDN (Cloudflare, S3 + CloudFront).
- Horizontal scale web servers behind a load balancer.
- Use database read replicas if your DB supports it.
- Optimize DB queries and add indices to heavy tables (threads, comments).
- Use Horizon (if using Redis queues) to monitor workers.

---

## CI / CD Recommendations

Use GitHub Actions or platform-native deploys:

Example GitHub Actions (outline):
- On push to main:
  - Run `composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist`
  - Run `npm ci && npm run build`
  - Run `php artisan test`
  - If tests pass, trigger deployment (via SSH, API, or platform deploy)

Store secrets in GitHub Secrets and never commit `.env`.

---

## Roadmap / Enhancements (suggested)

Short term:
- Rich text editor for posts
- Post likes/upvotes and trending sorting
- Mentioning and @notifications
- Image uploads with moderation

Medium term:
- Realtime updates via Pusher / Websockets
- Advanced moderation panel and reports
- SSO (OAuth with Discord/Steam/Google)

Long term:
- Mobile apps or PWA for offline/notifications
- Monetization options (premium features, donations)

If you'd like, I can open issues for the items above and propose initial milestones.
